EMIE-Data-Collection-Sample
===========================

This sample is provided to get you started collecting data about Enterprise Mode for IE11 usage within your organization.  It is intended to be used as a starting point to building your own data collection solution around Enterprise Mode.  To set up data collection, turn on Enterprise Mode logging either through group policy or by directly setting the Enable registry key.  Set the Enable setting to [deployment url]/api/records/ and data will automatically be sent to this page.

You will need Visual Studio 2013 with Update 2.
